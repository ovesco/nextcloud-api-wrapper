# Nextcloud API wrapper for PHP

This is a simple php wrapper around
- [user provisioning api](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/12/admin_manual/configuration_user/user_provisioning_api.html)
- [shares api](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/12/developer_manual/core/ocs-share-api.html)

which allows you to manage your nextcloud instance dynamically. It's meant to 
be the closest possible to the API, every parameter is available and method names should 
be understandable enough, dont hesitate to make use of the api documentation 
seeking help on what params are available for each method.

This library was partially tested with nextcloud 12 and 13. It was developed to fit my needs but I implemented all
remaining methods. If you find any bug, don't hesitate to open an issue.

##### Warning
> Nextcloud API uses basic http auth, which means username and password
are not encoded and travel the internet as clearly as possible. Make sure
to enforce it using SSL.

## Installation
Install it with composer
```
composer require soetz/nextcloud-api-wrapper
```

## Basic usage
The library depends on Guzzle to make requests and Symfony's options resolver.
```php

use NextcloudApiWrapper\Wrapper;

//The base path to Nextcloud api entry point, dont forget the last '/'
$basePath   = 'http://my.domain.com/nextcloud/ocs/';
$username   = 'admin';
$password   = 'potatoes';

$wrapper    = Wrapper::build($basePath, $username, $password);

// https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/12/admin_manual/configuration_user/user_provisioning_api.html
$userClient                 = $wrapper->getUsersClient();
$groupsClient               = $wrapper->getGroupsClient();
$appsClient                 = $wrapper->getAppsClient();

// https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/12/developer_manual/core/ocs-share-api.html
$sharesClient               = $wrapper->getSharesClient();
$federatedCloudSharesClient = $wrapper->getFederatedCloudSharesClient();

//Instance of \NextcloudApiWrapper\NextcloudResponse
$response   = $userClient->getUsers();
$code       = $response->getStatusCode();   //status code
$users      = $response->getData();         //data as array
$message    = $response->getStatus();       //status message
$guzzle     = $response->getRawResponse();  //Guzzle response
```

### Making your own requests
If you'd like to perform your own requests, you can use the underlying
nextcloud connection class to perform them.
```php
$connection = new \NextcloudApiWrapper\Connection($basePath, $username, $password);

//To perform simple requests
$response   = $connection->request('GET', 'cloud/users');

//To perform requests which needs the 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded' header
//and are not performed in POST
$response   = $connection->pushDataRequest('PUT', 'cloud/' . $username . '/disable');

//To perform requests which holds some values to submit
$response   = $connection->submitRequest('POST', 'cloud/users', [
    'userid'    => 'potatoes',
    'password'  => 'tortilla'
]);
```
